# Project Change Log

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-05
**Status:** Active

## Purpose

This file tracks meaningful project-level changes for the current implementation effort.

Use it for:

- project direction changes
- documentation workflow changes
- tooling changes
- architecture and delivery changes

Keep entries concise and oriented to what future work needs to know.

## Change History

### 2026-03-06 — Phase 2 Implementation Complete

**Summary:** All Phase 2 features implemented and committed to master.

**What changed:**
- `docs/assets/css/main.css` — full `@media print` block (hide nav/sidebar/context, full-width content, URL-after-links, page-break rules); diagram lightbox styles; lunr.js search dropdown styles; crosswalk comparison selector styles
- `docs/assets/js/main.js` — diagram lightbox IIFE (click `.mermaid` → full-screen SVG clone, close via ×/Escape/click-outside); lunr.js search IIFE (fetch search.json, index on load, arrow-key nav, XSS-safe DOM building)
- `docs/_layouts/default.html` — lunr.js CDN script tag added before `</body>`
- `docs/_includes/topnav.html` — search input with ARIA attributes and `data-search-url`
- `docs/assets/data/search.json` — new Jekyll Liquid template; renders valid JSON search index at build time
- `docs/crosswalks/compare/index.md` — new comparison selector page; two `<select>` dropdowns; hidden pair divs for NFPA79/IEC60204 and US electrical trio; vanilla JS selector logic
- `docs/crosswalks/index.md` — compare link added to crosswalk table

**Architecture:** All additive. Vanilla JS + CSS only. No new Jekyll plugins. CDN-only dependency (lunr.js).

**Next step:** `git push` then enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions).

### 2026-03-06 — Phase 1 Jekyll Site Implementation

**Summary:** Built the complete Phase 1 GitHub Pages static site under `docs/`.

**What changed:**
- Created `docs/` Jekyll scaffold with `_config.yml`, `Gemfile`, and vendor bundle (Ruby 2.6 / Bundler 2.4.22 local)
- Built three-panel layout: CSS Grid (240px sidebar + 1fr main + 220px context), responsive to tablet/mobile
- Mermaid.js CDN integration (theme: neutral) in default layout
- 48 HTML pages across all planned sections
- GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (deploys from master branch)
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `docs/_site/`, `docs/vendor/`, `docs/.jekyll-cache/`

**Site sections implemented:**
- Homepage: 8 content blocks (hero, standards cards, lifecycle ribbon, relationship diagram, industry matrix, scenarios, repo explorer, trust boundary)
- Standards: explorer landing, US Electrical (NEC, NFPA 79, UL 508A), International Machinery (IEC 60204-1), Functional Safety (ISO 12100, ISO 13849-1, IEC 62061, IEC 61508, IEC 61511)
- Lifecycle: landing + 11 stage pages
- Crosswalks: NFPA 79 ↔ IEC 60204-1, UL 508A/NEC/NFPA 79, Decision Workflow
- Scenarios: 5 pages (US Control Panel, Global Machine, Process Skid, Networked Safety PLC, Semiconductor Equipment)
- Industries: matrix landing + 9 industry overlay pages
- Software Stack, About

**Architecture decision:** Jekyll static site with custom CSS (no framework). Content sourced from RAG corpus paraphrase. `docs/` is presentation only — never modifies `rag/`.

**Next step:** Commit, push, enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (Source: GitHub Actions).

### 2026-03-06: Commit Automation Retargeted To Project-State Log

**Type:** Automation / Workflow
**Status:** Active

- Updated the Git hook installer and the installed pre-commit hook to stage `project_state/change_log.md` instead of the removed root `general_change_log.md`.
- Kept `project_state/change_log.md` as a manual project log instead of using it as an auto-generated generation-summary feed.
- Aligned project runbook and tooling docs with the new project-state tracking path.

### 2026-03-06: Project-State Workflow Established

**Type:** Documentation / Process
**Status:** Active

- Established `project_state/` as the operational tracking area for this project.
- Defined file ownership:
  - `project_state.md` for current phase, scope, and next implementation work
  - `environment.md` for runtime and deployment requirements
  - `how_to.md` for setup and run instructions
  - `change_log.md` for project-level change tracking
- Updated root documentation so the project state is discoverable from the repository root.
- Set the current delivery target to Phase 1 GitHub Pages deployment for personal use.

### 2026-03-05 — Phase 2 Planning Docs Added

**Type:** Planning / Documentation
**Status:** Active

- Added Phase 2 design doc: `docs/plans/2026-03-05-phase2-design.md`
- Added Phase 2 implementation plan: `docs/plans/2026-03-05-phase2-implementation.md`
- Features planned: print stylesheet, diagram lightbox, lunr.js inline search, crosswalk comparison selector
- Architecture: all additive changes to existing files; vanilla JS + CSS only; no build step; CDN-only deps
- Implementation structured as 2 releases (Release 1: print + lightbox; Release 2: search + comparison)

### 2026-03-05: Repository Reorganization Executed

**Type:** Structure
**Status:** Completed

- Consolidated the repository under `control-standards/` as the clear product root.
- Kept `control-standards/rag/` as the authoritative AI-readable knowledge path.
- Grouped standards content under `us/`, `international/`, and `crosswalks/`.

### 2026-01-15: Legacy Migration Tooling Created

**Type:** Historical Infrastructure
**Status:** Historical

- Migration helper scripts and migration documentation were created for an earlier repository layout.
- These records remain useful as project history but are not the primary workflow for the current structure.

## Notes

- Older migration and generation details remain available elsewhere in the repository as historical context.
- This file should stay focused on the active project and current implementation effort.
